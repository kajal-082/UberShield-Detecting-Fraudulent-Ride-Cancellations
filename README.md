# UberShield-Detecting-Fraudulent-Ride-Cancellations
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent ride cancellations by Uber drivers who cancel trips upon reaching the pickup location and offer offline rides at higher charges. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze ride data to identify patterns associated with such fraudulent behavior.

🚀 Features
Data Analysis: Explore ride patterns to detect anomalies.

Machine Learning Model: Train a classification model to detect fraudulent cancellations.

Evaluation Metrics: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure model performance.
